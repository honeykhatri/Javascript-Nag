problems with traditional web-application:
-----------------------------------------


  1. on every resp, 
    ==>browser re-loads current page with new page
  2. on every req , 
    ==>server should re-generate same layout(UI) again & again with new data, keeping client's state
  3. on every response , 
    ==> we r loading same assets ( css , images , icons , fonts , browser javascript ), increase n/w bandwidth

soln:

  SPA(Single Page Application) at browser-side using javascript
